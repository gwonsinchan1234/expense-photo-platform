# State / Data Handling Rules

- Use `useState` only for minimal state units.
- Compute derived values with `useMemo`.
- Extract async logic into separate functions.
- Do not skip null/undefined handling.
- Avoid adding unnecessary re-render triggers.
- Do not call async functions inside `map`/`filter`.
- Minimize memory copies for large datasets.
